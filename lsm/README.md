# Description
    An LSM tree is a data structure with performance characteristics that make it very attractive
    to store date with more write intensive throughput.

    This project aims to create a web application to educate users on LSM trees. 

# Dependencies

    In the lsm/backend directory, run the command
        npm install

    to install dependencies needed to run the backend.

    In the lsm/frontend/lsm-app directory, run the command
        npm install
